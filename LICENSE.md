10. Notice and Takedown Procedure for Copyright Complaints:  
It is our policy to expeditiously respond to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the United States Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). This page describes the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to Nanome as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the form suggested by the DMCA (the text of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office Website (http://www.copyright.gov), but we will respond to notices of this form from other jurisdictions as well.  
It is expected that all Users of any part of Nanome will comply with applicable copyright laws. However, if Nanome receives proper notification of claimed copyright infringement, our response to these notices will include removing or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity and/or terminating subscribers, regardless of whether we may be liable for such infringement under United States law or the laws of another jurisdiction.  
If we remove or disable access in response to such a notice, we will make a good-faith attempt to contact the owner or administrator of the affected site or content so that they may make a counter notification pursuant to 17 USC Section 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. We may also document notices of alleged infringement on which we act.  
11. Designated Agent:  
Nanome’s Designated Agent to receive notification of alleged infringement under the DMCA is: hello@nanome.ai  
Upon Receipt of proper notification of claimed infringement, Nanome will follow procedures outlined herein and in the DMCA.    
12. Modification:  
Nanome reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace any of these Terms on Nanome’s Site and/or Software by sending you notice through The Software by push notification or email or by posting such notice to The Site.

You may not opt out of these notifications, and your continued use of The Software following the posting of any changes to these Terms constitutes acceptance of those changes.  
13. Termination:  
Nanome may terminate, change, suspend or discontinue The Software (including, without limitation, the availability of any feature or content) or your access to all or any part of The Software at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately, which may result in the forfeiture and destruction of all information associated with your use of The Software.

16. Limitation of Liability:  
OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FROM ALL CAUSES OF ACTION AND UNDER ALL THEORIES OF LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE OR $1, WHICHEVER IS GREATER.

17. Exclusions:  
Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the limitations above may not apply to you. In these cases, Nanome liability will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by law.  
18. Arbitration:  
For any dispute you have with Nanome, you agree to first contact Nanome and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. In the unlikely event that Nanome has not been able to resolve a dispute within 30 days, we agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms, or breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration. Unless you and Nanome decide otherwise, arbitration will be conducted in California with the arbitrator of Nanome’s choice. If your claim is for US $10,000 or less, Nanome may approve your request to have arbitration conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the arbitration rules. Each party will be responsible for paying any filing, administrative and arbitrator fees. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for experts and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or equitable relief from the courts for matters related to the intellectual property rights or unauthorized access to The Software. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS YOU AND NANOME ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.  
19. Governing Law:  
These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to any conflict of laws, rules or principles.  
20. Other Terms:  
Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights.  
These Terms in conjunction with Nanome’s Privacy Policy constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Software, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.  
21. Severability:  
No part of this agreement shall cease to be in effect in any other part is deemed unenforceable or otherwise non-applicable.
